# Github Runnerboy
This short application / docker container starts your github runner.... 
You just have to conf / pass the github_repo_url and github_token_url and then it should working :)

I create the dockerfile using the files from the offical runner doc -> https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners


Checking that your self-hosted runner was successfully added
After completing the steps to add a self-hosted runner, the runner and its status are now listed under "Self-hosted runners".

The self-hosted runner application must be active for the runner to accept jobs. When the runner application is connected to GitHub and ready to receive jobs, you will see the following message on machine's terminal.
